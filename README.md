# Multitab Particle Bridge

This project is a real-time, multi-tab synchronized 3D particle visualization built with React, TypeScript, and React Three Fiber. Inspired by an Instagram video I saw, the goal was to recreate the illusion that browser tabs exist in the same shared 3D space â€” where spheres represent each tab, and bridges of glowing particles flow between them.

Here you can see the video that inspired this project: [https://youtu.be/4LwHH3r2qNY](https://youtu.be/4LwHH3r2qNY)

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

- React + TypeScript
- React Three Fiber (Three.js in React)
- GLSL Shaders (Custom point rendering)
- `localStorage`, `BroadcastChannel`
- GitHub Pages for deployment

## ðŸ’¡ Inspiration

Huge thanks to **BjÃ¸rn Gunnar Staal** ([bgstaal](https://github.com/bgstaal)) for the original concept. This was my attempt to recreate it without access to the source code of the interacting spheres.
